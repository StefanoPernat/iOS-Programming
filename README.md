# The Big Nerd Ranch iOS Programming 6th Edition

This is the repository I will use to learn iOS programming, it will be divided into branches for every chapter.

## A simple iOS application: Quiz

In this simple project I learned the basic structure of an iOS application, learned also a litte bit of AutoLayout.  
I have changed also the default app icon, and generated a launchscreen from main storyboard.

## The Swift Language

Experienced the basics of the Swift language, like *Variables and Constants*, *Type Annotation*,  
**Collection Types**, **Initializers**, **Properties**, **Instance methods**, **Optionals**, **Loops**, **Enumeration**. 

## Views and the View Hierarchy

Learned about Autolayout, through Interface Builder I learned how to use Autolayout for making the layout consistent on multiple resolution and screen sizes.  
I also practiced creating views programmatically, in this way I learned about iOS views hierarchy.

> **Bronze Challenge**: Remove all the constraints from **View Conroller** interface and then add them back in. Try to do this without consulting the book.
